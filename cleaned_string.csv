totally absolutely recommend movie anyone likes good wholesome family movies exactly
things four kids get absolutely hilarious watch
one best movies shows strong sibling bond
much interesting action suspense less unneeded controversy
everything acting cinematography solid
definitely worth checking
damian talented versatile many ways writing portraying different characters screen
movie cutting edge
pleased know modern day genius letting passion art drive taking us audience
new characters not memorable found forgetting
felt though going ireland absolutely nothing whatsoever
not make scared horrified make sympathetic towards characters simply annoying
jerky camera movements also annoying
plot pretty much every cheap horror
pathetic attempts give characters depth not really work rest plot
guess supposed clever twist shed light situation stupid
see probably leave shelf
elias koteas jack palance play good roles angelina hot gets naked billy drago appears cool usual cameo sven ole thorsen helps make enjoyable movie good acting decent budget
awesome movie bought ebay
really loved story line poler bear kinda cute anyone question fort steele ask away
totally unfunny movie top pathetic unrealistic throughout whole minutes utter torture probably looked watch times
lucy bell much higher crap sink low quite depressing
movie make sick watching slackers make excuses stupid actions minutes
god never get minutes back
think wonderful parts literally full wonder excerpts works
sets especially designed work camera amazing stylized beautiful effective
could used exemplars set designer
stories powerful explorations nature man art
watching film wanted learn works artist
highly recommend movie anyone interested art poetry theater politics japanese history
wind lion see wonderful rendering america imperial age
makes story different terrific production values faultless photography composition editing terrific casting underappreciated brian keith playing bully teddy vivid history
though wind lion told largely eyes son every member family identify one characters whether sean connery noble brigand candace bergen feisty heroine john huston wily john hay steve kanaly spiffy radiant ruthless lieutenant roosevelt big stick
high adventure best
think robert ryans best film portrayed someone like father schizophrenic real life father although never murdered anyone affected second world war made worse
humour get get day apt
mother brother saw robert ryan portraying type man good imitation type individual impressed
almost songs cover girl old fashioned not tuneful
annoying thing cover girl way rita hayworth put pedestal
unfortunately cover girl example hollywood used exploit women financial gain
non linear narration thus many flashbacks every part articulated quite well
good cinematography also makes monica bellucci look beautiful
good commentary today love undoubtedly film worth seeing
people first timers film making think excellent job
popular cinema good house good reactions plenty laughs
feel good film felt came cinema
northern humour positive community represents
rather enjoyed
liked
could not take seriously
really created unique feeling though
vivian schilling excellent job script
world better garbage theatres today

cant explain movie romantic charming hilarious adorable junkyard scenes funny junkyard dogs something special funny laughed kids love buy comes new features
chosen tortured disgusting piece blatant american propaganda
show made americans stupid full hatred clich admitted elsewhere
almost everyone involved must return school acting utterly predictable bad script pile garbage round
wish could enter negative values admins
sets bad would not look place thunderbirds episode
use slow motion needlessly repeats throughout movie well backed bad acting bad kind word no continuity scenes thrown no reason whatsoever vehicles looked like made corn flakes box directorial style bordered stupidity
oh yeah storyline pathetic
hate writing bad reviews films especially really like star film bad not believe one second anyone could proud
not filmmaker nor director would hide head sand would spent whatever amount money time movie
short monumental waste time energy would not recommend anyone ever see film
came free dvd player bought still turned thing halfway embarrassed howell
no setting
interesting premise billy drago always good dangerous nut bag side note would love see drago stephen mchattie lance hendrikson flick together talk raging cheekbones
soundtrack not terrible either
acting even professionals drago debbie rochon terrible directing worse perhaps contributory former dialog chimp like camera work barely tolerable
still sets got big oy vey scale
yes simplifying things sake brevity really core problems film much going without real fulfilling explanation
good jobs quite amusing
convoluted plot not convince much film watched weird questioning glance
let girlfriend talk seeing bad idea hated
last minutes movie also not bad well
bela lugosi totally extraneous intoning odd lines
acting decidely wooden though no worse period universal b movie
like armand assante cable company summary sounded interesting watched twice already probably
believe screenwriter good job tying loose ends
score mostly plot
not say not like spoilers not want one believe film worth time
wow bad film
not frightening least barely comprehensible
plot not hang together acting absolutely appalling
not even good camp value
not expecting oscar material
would iq particularly stupid mollusk not see one coming
film use word loosely insult movie going public
someone involved knew string together narrative
gets simply nothing lower
one not watched recently fox movie channel disappointed
know contract player little control scripts acting bad script
victor mclaglen even bad brian donlevy almost unrecognizable
considering relations screen taylor stanwyck surprising little chemistry screen two
premise film ridiculous president u
death row scenes entirely unmoving
thing worse taylor acting stanwyck singing
whatever producer going missed entirely
deeply impressed character played
knew saw film great things come gifted actor
cheap cheerless heist movie poor characterisation lots underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat better tomorrow cheesy clich thrown abandoned factory ready poorly executed flying judo rolls la john woo
even squibs look awful
no point proceedings look remotely like america
plot derivative predictable ending like mercy killing
awful dialogue hopeless overacting everyone gets shot top real waste space time
uneasy bad movie not scared
dialogue composed things make little sense
minutes footage wasted show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough make teen goth blush almost always olde english sometimes latin may may not made words
directing sloppy best
hackneyed writing certainly made even worse bad directing
course acting blah
acting whole cast could put scale balanced perfectly overacting underacting
finally get ending would great handled competent people not jerry falwell
loved movie great portrayal family share ups end knew special love
seen many movies starring jaclyn smith god one best though came years ago
movie contained star cast loved opened eyes see actors not seen
movie kind long length enjoyed every minute
overall rate movie scale
lifetime not air enough anyone knows store sells let know must
particularly remember senses assaulted strident cords music would blare little warning even less meaning
sort pap screened afternoon punish unemployed not jobs
totally different loads understatement black comedy film get see remember
movie creates universe fascinating every way
movie really got
see
really hope team behind movie makes movies continue kinda weird style
forgot casting superb trond fausa aurv g perfect role bothersome man not understand
movie good humorous comment life
found move beautiful enjoyable uplifting
initially local sites film filmed buffalo intrigued
later found lost power film
entire audience applauded conclusion film
left theater lilt step joy heart hope human race
duris wholesome appearance gives fine performance
rest cast also play well
cinematography noteworthy including fine views barcelona famed gaudi towers
ten minutes film started second thoughts
half way film started dislike
time film ended not disliked despised
film lacks convincing script
script looks rough draft written shooting began finished script completed
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur no real reason script calls
cast good
worth checking
probably irritating show ever seen entire life
indescribably annoying idiotic show ever seen
everything bad
could not understand kind idiot would produce mess first place not mention several season
script bad bad contains cheesiness unethical joke normally see rated r movie
casting also horrible cause see really really bad actors period
final word show real torture
zillion times away reality
watching washing machine twirling around would not hurt eyes much show
rating grade z note show bad even mother cast pull daughter show
century fox road house not quite silly noir implausible unmitigated bore movie
full unconvincing cardboard characters blandly written edward chodorov also produced surprisingly directed jean negulesco one would expect great deal
widmark character turns unintentionally comical
losing marbles early proceedings totally implausible unconvincing
not enough mess movie picture also marred constant use studio sets indoor exteriors
whatever prompted documentary beyond
serious spoilers movie huge disappointment
many problems dont know start
cast great
steve martin delivers really funny performance middle aged upper class uptight white guy
add betty white jean smart great cast everyone played parts really well
movie makes lot serious mistakes
first enough racial stereotypes racial jokes offend everyone
movie littered overt racial slurs towards black cast members return whites depicted morons boobs
putting race card aside lets look major flaw film destroy latifa character
no real plot
wouldnt see movie free
steamboat willie amazingly important film cinema history
second appearance mickey mouse following silent plane crazy earlier year probably famous film mostly ground breaking
not yet hear mickey speak tons sound effects music throughout film something take granted huge crowd pleaser
however seeing short years amazed timeless film actually
adorable seeing mickey playing turkey straw highly imaginative occasionally cruel way
clever real crowd pleaser film still ranks among mickey best films even wonderful years
bipolarity ruthless thug one minute ruthless killer next minute luv diaper commercial completely unconvincing
terribly disappointed film would receive many awards accolades especially far deserving works film
original body soul masterpiece
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada lee filmed one greatest cinematographers ever grace screen james wong howe
not think redeeming qualities remake
may bad film ever made
bad well bad
movie solid example bad plot bad idea way
shame see good actors like thomerson james make living mess like
thought bad
films terrible credit version watchable
let start problems acting especially lead professor bad
script big flawed mess
best example dumb writing established turn zombie students back humans removing necklace containing piece meteorite
director paul matthews also wrote directed weak monster movie grim clearly not know pace films
movie terribly boring places
lighting awful
film looks cheap bland
one disappointing aspects lack notable gore
convention never worked well past certainly not work
visual effects awful
cg opening sequence space looked like could created microsoft slideshow god sake
explosion gas tanks end awful
okay like consider fair critic give credit credit due creature effects actually pretty cool
gotta love close ups slimy drooling teeth
sum film breeders terrible cheaply made horror movie avoided like ebola virus
not recommended
almost unbearable watch screen little no charisma terrible comedic timing
aside terrible lead film loads debits
understand supposed cheap popcorn comedy not mean completely insult intelligence writing incredibly hackneyed borders offensive
lewis black considerable talent wasted incendiary unrestrained rating certainly not allow
film sole bright spot jonah hill look almost unrecognizable fans recent superbad due amount weight lost interim
originality freshness first movie spent remake little else offer
budget evidently limited
reflected not cast also par script borrowed much earlier classic
however no decent acting action location work balance things
filmiing less expansive
failed convey broad sweep landscapes great part original
generally lacked imagination
not recommended
possible movie get worse
no plot keep going first place
even women finally show no sign improvement expected things happen time film might far asleep
beware not trashy cult movie trash period
not believe even sequel
precisely giving bad review
child truly enjoyed show proudly say enjoyed big time even classical wb cartoons
tiny toons kept vibe delivered one popular funny underrated cartoons ever created
memories murky say enjoyed every single episode product related show
easily none cartoon made laugh tender way getting dark sitcoms oriented teenagers
characters funny peculiarity not true lead character
every single character hilarious deserved called lead
every element story top excessively phony contrived painful sit
lines seem written fifteen year old though trying oh hard sound like fifteen year old would really um know well talk
perabo nice energy level obviously comfortable front camera
simply no excuse something poorly done
saw movie thought stupid movie
even stupid thought idea volcano los angeles
honest unbelievable nonsense foolish
conclusion not bother movie volcano los angeles nothing nonsense
story line awful
painful
accents absolutely abysmal
also enough hypocrisy film make vomit
not waste time watching rubbish non researched film
believe pitch black done well
characters interesting want find longer movie goes think people surprised not make
go watch
omit watching
funny
rating
characters interesting really care
instant classic great soundtrack catchy song ending credits
not miss
masterful piece film making many themes simmering occasionally boiling warts study poet bohemian self indulgent wartime years span aerial bombardments london outward tranquillity welsh coastal retreat borderlines friendship lust love dedication art experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice egotism versus heroism self sacrifice
mature subtle script suggests occasionally brings dramatic focus underlying tensions well served perfect performances apart odd inappropriate smiling keira knightley prone though perhaps direction time characters often mention
exquisite visual composition moment inventive elegant use close camera angle lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage wonder joy behold
continuously beautiful look bertolucci relationships convincing narrative engaging master work
basic premise wasted since sidelined inexplicable focus documentary crew
regardless film fails levels
avoid costs
saw film christmas great film
thought errol flynn brilliant custer since become favourite actor
acting alongside olivia de havilland brilliant ending fantastic

say film excellently produced tops ratings typical sci fi film
excellently produced one sci fi best producers scot vandiver
entertaining nonetheless
campy sort film joy watch
barely boring moment film plenty humorous parts
cast always entertaining usual
overall delight

film lacks real scares tension medical terminology used throughout bit iffy say least say insulin dependant diabetic
least said acting better
